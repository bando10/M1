c DESCRIPTION: Geometric random graph.  DSJRx.y[c] is
c              a geometric graph with x nodes randomly
c              distributed in the unit square, and and edge
c              if the length of the corresponding line is
c              less than y.  This graph is then complemented
c              if a "c" ends the file name.  Graphs were used in
c
c              "Optimization by Simulated Annealing: An
c               Experimental Evaluation; Part II, Graph
c               Coloring and Number Partitioning" by
